#To The Moon

A space shooter game in the stlye of Galaga, Galaxian or Space Invaders. This game was inspired by my 7th grde days of playing Phoenix on the TI-83 calculator. The objective is to pilot a ship "To The Moon" and kill all enemies along the way. Enemies spawn in waves every 5 seconds and at the end of each day/level a store is opened with upgrades for purchase.

Potential Improvements

1. loading bar for gun. indicate when it is able to shoot again
1. Stats - accuracy, enemies killed, times played
1. infinite mode - access the store and semi-randomly generate enemies
1. explosive mode - start with best stuff, no store, see how far you can go
1. longer/better story mode
1. Moving particle background
