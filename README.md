A space shooter game in the style of Galaga, Galaxian or Space Invaders. This game was inspired by my 7th grade days of playing Phoenix on the TI-83 calculator. The objective is to pilot a ship and kill all enemies along the way. Enemies spawn in waves throughout the level, and at the end of a level a store opens offering upgrades to the player's ship.
