#To The Moon

A space shooter game in the style of Galaga, Galaxian or Space Invaders. This game was inspired by my 7th grade days of playing Phoenix on the TI-83 calculator. The objective is to pilot a ship "To The Moon" and kill all enemies along the way. Enemies spawn in waves throughout the level, and at the end of a level a store opens offering upgrades to the player's ship.

1. Stats - accuracy, enemies killed, times played
1. infinite mode - access the store and semi-randomly generate enemies
1. explosive mode - start with best stuff, no store, see how far you can go
1. longer/better story mode
1. Moving particle background
